            <p>

            Braydon is a junior, who is currently working on his Management Information Systems (MIS) degree.
            He is currently enrolled in the first half of his capstone class, Web app development, and two other classes.
            He enjoys various recreational activities like: walking and biking around, whether it is at standing bear lake or his neighbourhood.
            Aside from walking and biking, He dabbles in many other things. He tends to draw random things, dabble in art, take pictures of sunsets, build model cars, and play video games.
            He has previously worked for 4Star Concrete, his father's company, before working at Jersey Mikes. He has retained his job for about a year and a half now.
            During that time he has risen up to an Assistant to general manager. How he balances that and these classes, no one knows.
